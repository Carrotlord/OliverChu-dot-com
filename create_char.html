<pre style="font-family:Euphemia, Eurostile, Calibri, Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;" />Choose your major carefully. The major will determine what kind of internships
you can get and how much in-game money you can make at those internships.

There are 3 types of currency in this game:
- Dollars (analogous to United States Dollars in real life)
- Meal Points (analogous to University of California meal points in real life)
- Mint Emeralds (rare emeralds that you can only get by being really cool)

The interesting thing about this game is that dollars cannot be created
or destroyed. The game has a total of about 2 billion dollars in the
International Bank of Caliber.

You will get a chunk of that money when you sign up, because your parents
will take the money from their bank account. Alternatively, if you are
not upper middle class or beyond, you will get scholarship money, which
also comes from the bank.

You get more money by taking jobs.
Believe it or not, jobs can only be offered by other real-life
players who have enough money to pay you, just like how in real
life, only humans can be the employers of other humans.
You can also create your own startup company inside the game in order to
provide sales of goods &amp; services.

When the bank runs out of money, it will go into debt. It pays back this
debt by offering loans that have interest rates.

The only real way to create and destroy dollars is to enter the game,
take out a loan, spend the money, never pay it back, and then erase your
browsing history and also change your IP address, so that your account
essentially does not exist anymore.

Meal points can be purchased for dollars, and those dollars go back
into the University of California's bank account.
You cannot convert meal points back into dollars unless you do this (real life example).
Meal points can be freely created and destroyed by the UC system.
Unlike in real life, you can also use UC Berkeley meal points at
other places such as UC Irvine. Simply visit the other university
and spend your meal points there.

Mint Emeralds can only be obtained by:
1. Doing special (free) offers that I will give you, such as writing a useful
program in my scripting language or watching one of my YouTube videos.
NO EXTERNAL ADVERTISERS EXIST ON THIS WEBSITE.
2. Paying me real money. This is not actually suggested, because I
don't agree with games that tell you, "Oh &mdash; you have to buy more <span style="vertical-align:bottom;"><img style="vertical-align:bottom;" src="gold_coins.gif" alt="NX" /></span> now!"</pre>
